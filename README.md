# How to Run the Program

Make sure all files are in the same directory (bruteForceDiagnostic.py, llm_explainer, GUI.py, probability4e.py, and utils4e.py).
The only modification that needs to be made is replacing the API key in llm_explainer.py
The only file you need to run is the GUI.py file.
In a terminal you can run 'python GUI.py' and the GUI interface should pop up. 
Select the evidence values you want to test and click the 'Analyze' button to return the output in the textbox.

# Project Overview

The AI-Based Brute Force Detection Assistant is an Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity project that uses a Bayesian Network to estimate the probability of a brute force login attack.

The system allows users to select cybersecurity evidence through a graphical user interface and then performs probabilistic reasoning to determine the likelihood that a brute force attack is occurring.

An LLM-based explanation module is also included to provide human-readable explanations and recommended response actions based on the Bayesian Network results.

---

# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how Bayesian Networks can be applied to cybersecurity threat detection under uncertainty.

Instead of relying on simple rule-based logic, the system evaluates multiple pieces of evidence and computes a probability that a brute force attack is occurring.

---

# Threat Focus

This project focuses on a single cybersecurity threat:

**Brute Force Login Attacks**

The scope was intentionally limited to one threat category in order to build a more focused and interpretable Bayesian Network.

---

# Evidence Variables

The Bayesian Network uses the following evidence variables:

* Multiple Failed Login Attempts
* Repeated Attempts From Same IP
* Attempts Across Many Accounts
* Login Outside Normal Hours
* Suspicious IP / Geolocation
* Successful Login After Many Failures

Each variable can be selected as:

* True
* False

The evidence is used to estimate the probability that a brute force attack is occurring.

# Bayesian Network Structure

Evidence Nodes:

* M = Multiple Failed Login Attempts
* I = Repeated Attempts From Same IP
* A = Attempts Across Many Accounts
* O = Login Outside Normal Hours
* G = Suspicious IP / Geolocation
* S = Successful Login After Many Failures

Intermediate Nodes:

* L = Login Failure Pattern
* C = Suspicious Login Context

Target Node:

* B = Brute Force Attack

The Bayesian Network combines the evidence variables and calculates:

P(Brute Force Attack | Evidence)

using variable elimination inference.

# Graphical User Interface

The GUI was developed using Python Tkinter.

Features include:

* IP Address input type selection
* Evidence variable selection
* Analyze button
* Output display panel
* Bayesian Network integration
* LLM explanation generation

The GUI serves as the primary interface between the user and the diagnostic system.

---

# Example Output

Selected Evidence:

* Multiple Failed = True
* Same IP = True
* Many Accounts = True
* Outside Hours = True
* Suspicious IP = True
* Success After Failures = False

Possible Result:

Probability of brute-force attack: 92%

Risk Level: High

The LLM then provides:

* Explanation of the result
* Recommended response actions
* Human-readable cybersecurity guidance
