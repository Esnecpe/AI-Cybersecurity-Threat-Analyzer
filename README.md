# Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Assistant

## Overview

The Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Assistant is an AI-powered cybersecurity tool that analyzes suspicious IP addresses, URLs, and domains. The system combines real-world threat intelligence sources, Bayesian Network reasoning, and Large Language Model (LLM) explanations to help users identify potential cybersecurity threats and receive actionable recommendations.

This project was developed as part of an Artificial Intelligence course and demonstrates the integration of probabilistic reasoning, threat intelligence, and AI-generated explanations.

## Example Inputs

### IP Address

```text
185.220.101.5
```

### URL

```text
https://suspicious-login-verification.com
```

### Domain

```text
malicious-domain.net
```

## Example Output

```text
Diagnosis:
Brute Force Attack

Probability:
82.00%

Risk Level:
HIGH

Threat Score:
91%

Explanation:
The submitted IP address appears in multiple
threat intelligence reports and exhibits
behavior commonly associated with brute-force
attacks.

Recommended Actions:
- Block the IP address
- Review authentication logs
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Monitor for additional attempts
```
